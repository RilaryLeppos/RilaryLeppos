    <img align="left" width="200px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rilaryleppos/RilaryLeppos/main/fotor-bg-remover.png"/>
    <p align='justify'>I'm a student and passionate about User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX). </p>
    <p align='justify'>My goal is to learn more about the world of UI/Ux and become a constantly evolving professional in the field. I overcome my challenges knowing that I can contribute to improving experiences, facilitating what can be facilitated and further improving what already exists, always seeking the best version of myself. </p>
    <p align='justify'>Recently I started to develop interfaces, create wireflames and prototype entire projects, always respecting the principles of the designer and usability with the user. I started to document my studies and projects in the area, which can be found in the links at the end of this readme.</p>
